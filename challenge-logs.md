# 🏆 Goal
- profiency in CI/CD pipeline usign jenkins and github-actions
- terraform
- ansible 
- kubernetes
- and other important devops topics

# ️📝 Daily Logs
# 🗓️ Day 1: 
>- Today I have officially started 30 days of DevOps challenge. In next 30 days, I am dedicating myself to learn the essential DevOps concepts for MLOps which includes CI/CD, Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes and many more.

## ✅what I learned today ?
>- I learned about Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline, to be more precise, I learned the architecture of Jenkins both, master-slave agent based, and docker agent based, setup Jenkins master and salve agent on AWS ec2 instance, get hands on setting up CI/CD pipeline

## 🎯what I will do tomorrow?
>- will work on documenting what I learned today
>- will continue on building more complex CI/CD pipeline



# 🗓️ Day 2:
## ✅what I learned today ?

>- credential binding (hide sensitive variables into an environment instead of directly using it into a pipeline setup code)
>- covered about shared libraries and how to setup crone job and SMTP for gmail notification in Jenkins. Still need to work on how to deploy the two-tier app on eks using Jenkins.

>- I have decided to hold Jenkins until I got comfortable with Ansible, Terraform and Kubernetes. Today, I have also learned about basic of computer networking like OSI model and TCP/IP architecture, subnetings and routings.

>- I have also covered github branching strategies.

## 🎯what I will be doing tomorrow ?
>- will start Ansible course
>- Could not got time to document yesterday's and today's learning, so try to document that. 

# 🗓️ Day 3:
## ✅what I learned today ?
>- Got occupied with office work and writing a Medium article, so I couldn’t cover many new topics today.
>- I have also covered theoretical part of VPC (virtual private Cloud) and its components like internet gateway, public subnet, private subnet, NACL (Network Access Control List), security group, route53, NAT.

## 🎯what I will be doing tomorrow ?
>- Write documentation covering both yesterday's and today's topics.
>- gonna cover the practical implementation of VPC and its components in detail, from setting up VPC and other configurations to understanding their purposes.

# 🗓️ Day 4:
## ✅what I learned today ?
>- I have covered concepts like load balacer, auto scaling group, target group, bastion host or jump server.
>- Went through a tutorial on how to setup production level VPC with two availability zones, public and private subnets, load balancer and auto scaler.
>- Unfortunately I was unable to implement it because of the internet issue, will try to do that tomorrow and also try to write notes if I get any spare time.

## 🎯what I will be doing tomorrow ?
>- setup production level VPC with loadbalancer and auto scaler on aws
>- write notes and documentations


# 🗓️ Day 5:
## ✅what I learned today ?
>- I covered different architectures of VPC on aws (no practical implementation)
>- prepared proper notes for the network introduction chapter

## 🎯what I will be doing tomorrow ?
>- Still need to prepare notes on network security, VPC and its components, so will work on that.
>- If I get some extra time, I will implement VPC architectures on aws.

# 🗓️ Day 6:
Skipped for today

# 🗓️ Day 7:
## ✅what I learned today ?
>- prepare notes for missed out topics 
>- unable to implement due to access restriction, so have to wait for the access to create VPC

## 🎯what I will be doing tomorrow ?
>- will do the implementation
